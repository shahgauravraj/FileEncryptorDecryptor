### Abstract

File Encryptor Decryptor, also called as File Security System is a Java based system application which helps in
managing files and folders of any format securely. This program is primarily focused
on storing files safely inside a computer in an encrypted format so that only intended users could have access to it.
This application could be used in any PCs, however, this software has a better scope of use in systems which are
shared among multiple user.
To make the program efficient and easy for the users to interact with, we have designed a very minimalist
GUI using JavaFX. Additionally, this program is capable of
restricting unknown users from accessing the file by simply locking them after a few invalid attempts.
