### Abstract

File Encryptor Decryptor, also called as File Security System is a Java based system application which helps in managing files and folders of any format safely. This program is primarily focused on storing files securely inside a computer in 
an encrypted format so that only authorised users could have access to it. This application could be used in any PCs, however, this software has a better scope 
of use in systems which are shared among multiple user.

To make this program efficient and easy for users to interact with, we have
designed a very minimalist GUI using JavaFX. Additionally, this program is capable of restricting unauthorised users from accessing file by simply encrypting them using a key set by its user.
